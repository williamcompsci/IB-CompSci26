# Layers of Computing Systems

Layer one: Information

Machine language, Binary number system, data representation of text, image, audio, video, etc.

Layer two: Hardware

CPU, GPU, RAM, circuits, memories, logic gates, physical hardwares

Layer three: Programming

The instructions used to accomplish computations and manage data to solve problems

Algorithm: batching, looping, etc. 

Layer four: Operating System

Managing the computer’s resources and provide a platform to interact for both user and application software.

Layer five: Applications

Programs to make use of the computer’s abilities to solve specific real-world problems. 

Layer six: Communications

Communicating with other computers to share information and resources.

Related Assessment Statement

  Define the terms bit, byte binary

  Representing the infinite world: Representing just enough of the world to satisfy our needs and our senses of sight and sound

  Information is processed data

  Data is the raw form of information. After processing you get information.

  Analog and Digital Information

  Analog - Continuous representation, analogous to the actual information it represents
  
  Digital data: A discrete representation, breaking the information up into separate elements

  Computers cannot work well with analog data, so we digitize the data
  
  Digitize: Breaking data into pieaces and representing those pieces separately.

  Analog continually fluctuates in voltage up and down

  A digital signal has only a high or low state, corresponding to the two binary digits

  All electronic signals degrade as they move down a line

  The voltage of the signal fluctuates due to environmental effects

  Periodically, a digital signal is re-clocked to regain its original shape.

  Re-clock: repeat waves to increase the cover area for a certain device (e.g wifi)

Computers have storage units called binary digits or bits

  This is the smallest unit of data

  It can hold one of the two values: 0 or 1, the foundation of all computer operations

  Bits can be grouped together to make them easier to work with

  The number of bits in a word determines the word length of the computer, usually a multiple of 8

  32 bit machines

  64 bit machines etc

  b = bit

  B = byte = 8 bit

Word Length: the amount of information that can be processed per cycle (hertz)

Example: In a 64 bit machine, the CPU can process 64 bits of information per cycle. 

For instance, a 

Each CPU has a BUS which can carry the word length. 

How many bits are needed to represent 32 things? One hundred things?

How many things can n bits represent? Why

What happens every time you increase the number of bits by one?

Representing Negative Values

Two’s Compliment

Byte is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits

It is a standard unit used to represent data in computers, and it can represent 256 different values

For Unicode: Remember how many bits are needed (UTF - 8, UTF - 16, UTF - 32) and how many possible letters.

Remember the number of bits for ASCII and why it is 7 - 8 bits. 

Boolean Algebra

George Bool

In Boolean Algebra the variables only represent on or off/ true of false

And Or Not logics (与或非门)

Not: Only true if the input is false

And gate: only true if both inputs are true

Or: Only off if both are false

XOR: Only true if one input is false and one input is true, otherwise always false.
